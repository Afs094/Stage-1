    <!-- This is the basic, barebones of an HTML webpage. <hr/> and <br/> are good for creating a space between the 
      paragraphs, and also I must remember myself that there are always two elements: head and body inside the html, 
      both are child to the html. The heading can be from h1 to h6 depending on the size that I want it to go. -->
